            <p>Hey, I'm Sarah, and I'm 18. I enjoy hanging out with people and exploring new restaurants. I'm currently in college working towards my information technology degree, with hopes of becoming a Database Administrator or Data Analyst in the future. One of my life goals is to one day retire my parents.</p>
            <p>I have a cute pet cat that I love more than anything. His name is Pishu!</p>
