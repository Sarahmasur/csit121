            <h3>Self Reflection:</h3>
            <p>After completing my final Project Pages, I gained a better understanding of HTML. Despite struggling with the CSS page, I successfully completed it. Balancing creativity with functionality presented a challenge, but witnessing the final website come together was immensely satisfying. This CSIT 121 class has taught me a lot about building websites. I found the textbook to be very helpful, and I hope everyone enjoyed my website.</p>
