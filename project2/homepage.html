        <h2>About My Project</h2>
        <p>My name is Sarah Masur, and I'm thrilled to share my life journey through my portfolio, which will showcase my personal interests and thoughts. My project aims to educate people about Islam and the challenges of fitting into two different worlds, as an Afghan-American. I am determined to promote greater understanding and clarity around Islam, and I will use my portfolio to do so. Also, my updated resume will be included. Enjoy!</p>
